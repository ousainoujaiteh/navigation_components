# Blank HTML and SASS Template for Experimenting Code

As [Chen Hui Jing](https://www.chenhuijing.com) put it, "When trying to learn any CSS property, have a blank HTML template on hand so you can play around in a clean sandbox environment. I know we have Codepen and all, but I like a blank slate for distraction-free experimentation."

## SASS
You can simply watch the sass files by just doing sass --watch sass:css then the main.scss file in the SASS will compile to main.css in the CSS folder.

## CSS Reset
Iâ€™m linking to a CDN of [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

## Gulp
Later we will do this with gulp so that, we will not waste time reloading the page, compiling the sass our self and so on.
